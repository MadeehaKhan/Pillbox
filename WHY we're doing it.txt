WHY we're doing it

Intro

UML diagram

User study after we have a UI
	can people find thigns
	does it take a long time to get through the app
	IMPORTANT: are you making a choice that makes it better or worse

Statistics : how many people get admitted to hospitals because of a mistake with medication, etc.

Testimonials: say something like "with this app, this problem would blah blah blah"
								"there is a problem"

Think about the audience:
	what are they going to get out of this
	are there UI design issues you've come up with a solution to
	are there safety issues?
		is there a good story?
	concrete examples
	risks can turn into requirements/tests

Some things might not work with Flutter
	ML/image recog


Server language and its role
	thin client?
	easy to do ML in python but uh. not a good idea
	maybe Java
	or Scala

Ask about funding for AWS/poster etc
	digitalocean
