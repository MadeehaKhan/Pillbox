\begin{block}{Introduction}
The idea behind Pillbox is to build an application which will help patients and pharmacists better keep track of medication dispensary and usage. The application is mainly geared towards patients, and will serve a wide range of users, including the elderly and children. \\
Nowadays, pharmacies have high-tech methods of dispensing, counting, and keeping track of medications and prescriptions. However, the user experience for patients has remained stagnant. Patients still need to count their own remaining medication, set various alarms, and set their own reminders to get prescriptions for important drugs refilled. The model of the traditional pill organizer was the inspiration for this project, and will be largely featured in the application, to make the app a familiar landscape and make it more intuitive for users.\\
Pillbox will use the latest technology available to make the patient experience as secure, efficient, and user-friendly as possible.

\begin{block}{Inspiration: Jigsaw Teaching Framework}
Jigsaw provides a social learning framework. It was introduced in 1971 by Dr. Elliot Aronson to defuse hostility and distrust between students after the desegregation of public schools in the US \cite{aronson2002building}.

The jigsaw teaching technique mainly consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Dividing subject material into segments and creating groups of the same size,
	\item Assigning one segment to each student and having them become experts in it,
	\item Have students present their segments to each other,
	\item Finally, test students on all segments of the subject material.
\end{enumerate}

Many studies have shown that students using the jigsaw teaching technique had higher levels of self-esteem, performed better on standardized exams, enjoyed school more, and worked together better than in traditional classroom settings.

\begin{itemize}
\item Operating for over a decade, student volunteers taught 10,000+ students over the last 2 years
\item Elm graphics programming designed to be connected to math curriculum
\item We have shown measurable increases in math skills (see Figure \ref{barchart})
\item Actively investigating improving computer science, physics, math and literacy teaching

\begin{block}{Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 week, part of Science Odyssey 2018
\item 408 animations / static graphics created by grade 6-8 classes from 7 schools
\item 5 reading games created by grade 11 and 12 students incorporate those animations
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Conclusions \& Future Work}
The design of this activity takes advantage of network effects without the privacy concerns that usually
come with it. This activity was very well-received by teachers and students.
 It was found that we got a 
network effect with the value of animations / games. Initial animations encouraged high school students to make better games which in turn encouraged the elementary
students to make better animations. The high school students were then encouraged to make even better games, creating a positive cycle. In the future, we will develop more activities similar to this one.
